1 - In the first part of the project, i've created a Crud for brands and products, a good style for the page using bootstrap and i made the connection between the sql database and project.

2 - In the second part of the project, i've created functions to login, logout, sign-in and authentication to use the CRUD (you can only use the CRUD if you are log-in)
